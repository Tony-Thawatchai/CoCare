# CoCare 

  ## Problem
  Juggling work and parenting schedules is not an easy task. Parents want to do their best in both worlds. Paying for daycare can be expensive, and even if you can afford it, it doesn't mean it is available. Even if you are lucky enough to get one, your daycare schedule is still not flexible in case your work schedule accidentally changed.
